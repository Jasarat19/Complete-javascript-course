/////////////VARIABLES
Varible name convention
-lowerCamelCase
-dont use upper case at first but in oop we can use so better not to use it.
-PI-- all upper case as it is constant dont change
-variable should  be readable

rules
-cannot use new, function as they are reserved keyword in javascript
-cannot follow a numeric literal.i.e-let 3years = 3;
-variable can only contain numbers ,letters ,dollar sign ,underscor.
-we can use name but this is also reserved keyword so better not to use name.

//////////DATA TYPE
7 PRIMTIVE DATATYPE
-numbers - floating points numbers ,(used for decimals and int).--int or deci nai in javascript
-string - sequence of characters , used for text! USE ''/"" FOR THIS OR ELSE JavaScript will get confused.
-boolean-logical type true or false
-undefined- Value taken by a variable hat is not yet defined(empty value) 
-null- empty 
-symbol- ES2015 value that is unique and cannot be changed (not useful)
-bigIntn- larger integer than Numbr type can hold.
JavaScript has dymanic typing -DATA TYPE of the value stored in a variable is determined automatically.

//--comment
let and var are for not constantvariable
const is for const variable
we dont need to decare a variable we can just right name1 =dfv;
but this is terrible because this declared in global Varible;
